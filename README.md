# Alice - Kei Murota fork of Fluidity, an Startpage 


1. Clone the git repository.
2. Open a terminal in the project folder (If you execute the command `ls` here, there should be a package.json)
3. Execute `npm i` to install all dependencies
4. Execute `npm run start` to validate that everything ids working. A browser tab with the URL `http://localhost:3000` and the startpage should open.
5. Now you can change the code, for example write your own default values into `/src/data/data.ts`
6. Compile the project by executing `npm run build` if everything is done
7. Your startpage is now located in the `/build/` folder
8. Optional: If you host it with github pages yourself, you can use the command `npm run deploy` to push a fresh build into the gh-pages branch
